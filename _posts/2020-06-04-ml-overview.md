When building knowledge about a new field, it's always good to take a step *up* and look at the overall context from above. Where does this field belong? What parts/groupings/abstractions exist? How to they connect? What do people call them?

There are lots of different *views / lenses* to look the Machine Learning field, some structured around types of problems to solve, others around algorithms, others around learning types, etc. There is never just *one* view, how easy would that be?

## High level view

![ML Simple Overview](/assets/ml-simple-overview.png)

As you can imagine, this is a overly simplistic view, but enough for now.

**Artificial Intelligence**: the field that encompasses computational approaches that use knowledge, reasoning, learning and decision making to make machines mimic human behaviour and act 'smarter'.

**Machine Learning**: a sub-field of AI that contains the tools and techniques to enable machines to learn from experience —which comes in the form of data. We define a goal, combine the available algorithms and input the data, then the machine will 'learn' the best way to achieve the goal based on the data available —it creates a model to solve the problem, instead of us telling the machine 'exactly' what to do to.

**Neural Networks**: a class of models that is based on the way neurons work. This is just another technique to do ML and the reason why it's separate here is because it's the entry point to Deep Learning, probably the hottest ML sub-field. Neural Networks are very general and can be applied to almost any problem in ML (but some other methods might be more accurate or faster).

**Deep Learning**: neural networks are composed of layers of 'neurons', Deep Learning is defined by the ability to have *many* layers between the input and output, allowing for deeper inferences from the given data. The potential to do this has always been there, but it only became practical over the past few years with the increase in computational power (GPUs) that enables training models composed of hundreds of layers against huge databases of information.

So... a super simple high level view just to get it started. The next step is to look at the ML field with different lenses to learn a bit more about how it's structured. Post coming soon.
