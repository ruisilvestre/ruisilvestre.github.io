If you wanted to start learning a new technology today, what would that be?

Answering the question can be a bit of a rollercoaster since there are so many nice
shiny things out there tech-wise, each with its own benefits and learning curve to deal with.
Web front-end? Cross platform mobile? Functional programming languages? Computer vision?
AWS/GCP/Azure specialization? AI? AR? *insert million more here*...

It can feel overwhelming to make 'the right' choice, but guess what... there is no right choice.
There's only your motivation to become good at something and being ready to overcome the natural
obstacles that will appear along the way. The prize will be laid out along the road you take.

### Making a choice
It's critical to ask **why** and **understand the context** before making a choice, this will provide a
foundation to point the compass in a good direction before you start walking.

To make my choice I considered 3 things:

- my current skill-set and experience
- a sorted list of technologies I'm excited about
- the future of those technologies

After going through this process, my choice was to jump on the **Machine Learning** bandwagon Θ

- I like the methodical, question asking, experimentation led nature of the field
- All the big players are releasing new frameworks to harness ML on and off device
- ML field has strong foundations —it's been around for some time, but is now is being used to solve business problems at scale
- ML field has a future —there is so much latent data, many untapped markets and more applications still to find
- ML is a reasonable entry point into the AI space from someone with a strong software engineering background (Vs jumping straight into some other more complex AI sub-field)

### Making a plan
Once you make a choice I recommend creating a plan and goals to help you stay true to your path. Plans do change,
so don't be too fussed about adjusting as you go.

My high level plan for the first **3 months**:
- Focus on hands-on approach Vs theory driven
- Write about what you learned regularly (2x week)
- Use a structured approach (course-like materials)
- Besides the structured content, put aside 1h every day to learn a new topic
- Use different media to learn: blogs, books, videos
- Prioritise content from the big 4 (microsoft, google, apple, aws)
  - ... but don't stay hostage to a particular platform (yet)
- Compile a list of the best resources I found
- Compile a list of interesting business problems being solved by companies
- Have a portfolio of work you can show in the end, even if simple

### Why Kaggle
After browsing and reading reviews about (too) many potential online courses on ML, I decided to follow the [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) materials provided by the Kaggle platform.

Independently of the competition part of Kaggle (which I won't be focusing on), the fact that their materials are mostly hands-on exercises, problem solving driven, and don't go into *deep* detail on how each of the algorithms work, really aligns with what I am looking for. It feels good to be able to use the experience I already have as a developer, instead of just learning new concepts all the time.

I do want to learn about the details and internals of the methods, but I don't think that's the way to start for me. I did the first 4 weeks of the widely known ML course from Stanford by Andrew Ng previously, and even though I enjoyed it, this approach feels more natural to me.

### What's next
Not sure... I'll walk this part first and then re-evaluate. I might suck eggs at it and give up, or find a new treasure trove of ideas to start something new, or take a ML certification on one of the big 4 to open new doors, or..., or...

Working in the tech industry is a privilege, there's always something to do.
